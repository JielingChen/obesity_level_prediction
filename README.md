## Obesity Level Prediction
This project is my homework for CIS 9660 - Data Mining for Business Analytics.  
The goal of this project is to utilize the obesity level dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition) and develop machine learning models that can accurately predict obesity levels basing on different lifestyles and physical conditions.  

The project consists of 7 parts:  

**(1) Introduction:**
* Provides an overview of the dataset and the project objectives.  
  
**(2) Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:**
* Involves a thorough examination of the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns.
* Performs feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the models.  
  
**(3) K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes:**
* Implements K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes algorithms and assesses the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.
* Interprets classification reports of these two models.  
  
**(4) Model Selection:**
* Utilizes K-fold cross-validation technique to evaluate and select the most accurate model.
* Explores different machine learning algorithms and compares their performance.  

**(5) Hyperparameter Tuning:**
* Uses random search to optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its performance.

**(6) Model Validation:**
* Evaluate the performance of the tuned model on unseen data to ensure its generalization capability.
  
**(7) Business Insights:**
* Interprets the model's feature importances to identify the most influential factors in classifying obesity levels.


Parts (1)-(3) were done according to the instructor's requirements, while parts (4)-(7) were done out of personal interest to extend the analysis and enrich the overall results.
